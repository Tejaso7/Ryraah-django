        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: medium;">Stunning silver steals the light like
    nothing else. Pure silver also possesses a great value in the market, so
    valuables prepared from the material tend to come with a levitated price tag
    than those that barely appear like silver. And so, like other valuable
    substances, silver also possesses unique properties that can assist you to
    recognize it. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: medium;">Without making any noticeable mistake;
    almost everything these days in this world can be faked easily. So, if you're
    wondering if your piece of silver jewellery is real or fake or planning to buy a
    pure silver bracelet or a piece, here are a few ways to know if your bracelet
    and other items are created from pure silver or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><ul><li><span style="text-indent: -18pt; font-size: medium;">A commercially brought-in
    silver object in almost all countries is engraved with one or more silver
    hallmarks depicting the purity of the silver, the tag of the manufacturer or
    silversmith, and other markings to depict the manufacturing date and other
    information about the silver piece.</span></li></ul><div style="text-indent: -24px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><ul><li><span style="font-size: medium;">Get some magnets and check if
    they get attracted to your silver piece or not. Silver is not remarkably
    magnetic and reveals only fragile magnetic effects, unlike iron, nickel, and
    cobalt metals. If your magnet attracts strongly to the piece, it possesses a
    ferromagnetic core and is not purely silver.</span></li></ul><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><ul><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN-US" style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: -18pt;">Pure silver is completely
    odourless. If the piece smells like sulfur or posses a distinct metallic smell,
    then it is not a pure silver item. It could be a silver-plated item as well.</span></span></li></ul><div style="text-indent: -24px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><ul><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN-US" style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: -18pt;">Silver requires to be polished
    on a regular basis. Rust or a deficiency of oxidation depicts that the piece is
    prepared of a different element from silver. Rub and wipe the tarnished item as
    if polishing. If no black residue is seen, it's not pure silver.</span></span></li></ul><div style="text-indent: -24px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><ul><li><span style="font-size: medium;">Some pieces may be
    silver-plated, meaning that they are surrounded by a layer of original silver.
    Try to scratch the piece with your fingernail and check for another substance
    below it (try only if you have purchased the piece). If seen, then the item is
    plated with silver but is not completely a pure silver item.</span></li></ul><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><ul><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN-US" style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: -18pt;">Pure silver items possess the
    capability to melt the ice at a rapid rate even at room temperature. So, if an
    ice cube melts faster when in contact with the silver-looking piece, it
    definitely pure silver.</span></span></li></ul><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">
